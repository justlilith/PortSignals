# Port Signals Branding and Styling

In addition to the square mark, we try to keep a consistent styling for Port Signals communications.

## Color

The official Port Signals color is a bright blue (#00CCFF), not unlike a clear sky.

## Mark

We use a square mark, halved by the sky. When placing the mark, please try to keep a clear space around the mark of at least 25% of the mark's size; this preserves the grouping of the name when the mark is next to other text.

(Please see /images/official-mark for the full Port Signals mark and construction blueprint/guidelines.)
