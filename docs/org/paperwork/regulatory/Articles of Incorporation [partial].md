## Body

### Preface

Port Signals is an Internet-native nonprofit/profit-adjacent collective of artistic individuals who work toward a more clear, compassionate, and understandable tomorrow. It is a collective with no formal/voting members, and Port Signals does not require dues, nor are there formal votes regarding foundation direction.

Instead, Port Signals is managed by a Core Team, who are all Directors; in Core Meetings, votes of Directors may be taken, and recorded along with meeting notes, as Port Signals shifts direction. Votes are not mandatory, but the recording of decisions is.

This document holds the elements of Port Signal's foundation, formatted similarly to Form 202—General Information (USA). For example, the access levels, bylaws, and memberships (as of 2024) are listed here. Other documents in this folder provide supplemental information formatted clearly in Markdown as plain text, with accompanying media as necessary.

Handles/usernames in this document reflect actual people. For privacy's sake, some information is withheld.

All questions may be directed to Lilith. In lieu of correspondence with Lilith, any Port Signals L1 (and ascending) staff should be able to assist you.
