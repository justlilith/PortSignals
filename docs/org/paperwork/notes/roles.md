# Roles Nomenclature

There are a few roles which cover levels of responsibility and scope for working with Port Signals. Everyone L1 and above keep the lights running. However, creators are also directly responsible for organising, improving, observing and reporting on, and keeping accountable/auditable the Port Signals projects the√Ω nurture.

Note: The Director designation exists alongside levels; a director is definitely a contributor, but might not be a creator.

## Levels

Level designations cover how data is kept confidential, private, and secure.

### Everyone / The Public (Level 0 / L0)

Anyone can interact with unmarked Port Signals materials (bearing the mark but not a level indicator). These include articles, papers, books, and other media.

### Contributor (Level 1 / L1)

Contributors update and improve Port Signals materials and collective operations. For example, they may modernize meetings or maintain Port Signals core projects (such as the repository or microsite).

Any internal/private Port Signals project data should be marked L1 at the least.

### Creator (Level 2 / L2)

A creator actively develops projects under the Port Signals mark (for example, a researcher might develop a work in concert with Port Signals). These projects remain the core responsibility of the creator who founded them, with assistance from all Port Signals staff (L1 and above).

### Director (Di)

Port Signals staff/agents legally responsible for its continued operation; also known as the Core Team

Note: Port Signals staff may, but are not required to, wear many hats. For details regarding what duties a staff member is responsible for, you may check their personnel file.
