## Body

### Preface

Port Signals is an Internet-native nonprofit/profit-adjacent collective of artistic individuals who work toward a more clear, compassionate, and understandable tomorrow. There are no formal members; Port Signals does not require dues, nor are there formal votes regarding foundation direction. Port Signals is managed by a core team, who are all Directors; in Core Meetings, votes may be taken.

This document holds the elements of Port Signal's legal foundation. For example, the access levels, bylaws, and memberships (as of 2024) are listed here. Other documents in this folder provide supplemental information.

Because this repo exists before Port Signals is legally recognized, handles/usernames may not reflect current reality, temporally speaking. However, every effort must be made to continually note the names and contributions of Contributors, Volunteers, and Creators.

All questions may be directed to Lilith. In lieu of correspondence with Lilith, any Port Signals L1 (and ascending) staff should be able to assist you.
