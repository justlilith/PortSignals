## Body

This folder holds the elements of LOTUEL's foundation. For example, the officers, bylaws, and memberships (as of 2024) are listed here.

Because this repo exists before Lotuel is legally recognized, handles/usernames may not reflect current reality, temporally speaking.

All questions may be directed to Lilith. In lieu of correspondence with Lilith, any Lotuel Volunteer should be able to assist you.

Kindest,
Lilith
