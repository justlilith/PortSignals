## What is this?

Port Signals is a collective of artists, created for the express purpose of developing works that help people, as an expressly nonprofit foundation with plans to incorporate. The mark itself is applied to new media (Internet-based and sourced) that exists to make life more amenable for all. As an example, a collection of guides to navigating social norms could be produced with the help of Port Signals.

Because it's a collective, creatives working with Port Signals help other creatives work on their best efforts.

## What is this repo?

Port Signal's organizational materials, in plain-text. We're choosing GitHub as a temporary base while we build out the site and associated platforms.

## What does the name mean?

The name comes from the vision of a static port, that broadcasts signals. The port helps those who come across it, without seeking anything in return. Port Signals crafts are similarly created to help others who find them.

## How does this structure work?

Port Signals collaborators publish creative work under the Port Signals tag/mark. They keep all of their profits because they manage goods themselves. This is a clear separation from earnings pools or downlines. As a collaborator, what you make reinforces the signals you send out.

For example, Lilith is a Port Signals collaborator. She might publish a short film with accompanying PDF guide. Lilith chooses to release it as part of Port Signals, to better reinforce the mark for others.

## Future plans?

Ideally, Port Signals can function as a foundation that allots grants to artists/creatives in return for their commitment to producing art which elevates life, and its care and keep.
