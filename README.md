# Port Signals

*Collaborative creativity for our greater good.*

**Ars viv ars ad viv et aux.**

(Translation: The art of living is the art of living and helping.)

Port Signals is an Internet-native nonprofit/profit-adjacent collective of artistic individuals who work toward a more clear, compassionate, and understandable tomorrow.

## What is this?

Port Signals is a collective of artists, created for the express purpose of developing works that help people, as an expressly nonprofit foundation with plans to incorporate. The mark itself is applied to new media (Internet-based and sourced) that exists to make life more amenable for all. As an example, a collection of guides to navigating social norms could be produced with the help of Port Signals.

Because it's a collective, creatives working with Port Signals help other creatives work on their best efforts.

## What is this repo?

Port Signal's organizational materials, in plain-text. We're choosing GitHub as a temporary base while we build out the site and associated platforms.

## What does the name mean?

The name comes from the visage of a static port, that broadcasts signals to those who can hear them. The port helps those who come across it, without seeking anything in return. Port Signals crafts and efforts are similarly created to help others.

## How does this structure work?

Port Signals collaborators publish creative work using the Port Signals tag/mark. They keep all of their profits because they manage goods themselves; Port Signals is an amplifier as much as a mark, and so we do not use it as a business, but as a label. This is noted as a clear separation from earnings pools or downlines. As a collaborator, what you make reinforces the signals you send out, and Port Signals boosts those signals.

For example, Lilith is a Port Signals collaborator. She might publish a short film with accompanying PDF guide. Lilith chooses to release it as part of Port Signals, to better reinforce the mark for others.

## Future plans?

Ideally, Port Signals should function as a foundation that allots grants to artists/creatives who produce art which elevates life, its care, and its keep.
